                <h3>Java 2D Game Project</h3>



                <p>



                    My first game project, as part of my Java module at University.
                    This is a 2D platformer I made, similar to the 2D platformers of old such as Mario and the like.
                    This game demonstrates an understanding of the use of collision listeners, trackers, GUI and more.
                    A shard is to be collected on each level before being able to advance on to the next. HiScores are
                    in place to track who was able to perform the best throughout the game, by taking the least amount of hits
                    that they could.
